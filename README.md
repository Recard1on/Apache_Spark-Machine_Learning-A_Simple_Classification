# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Development with Apache PySpark

### Introduction

In this project, I utilized Apache PySpark to read data stored in Hadoop HDFS,
performing various analyses to derive insights. I developed a machine learning model
using Spark ML, training it on the dataset and evaluating results. Finally, I imported
the obtained results into a PostgreSQL database hosted in a Docker container.
